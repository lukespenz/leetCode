To find the longest substring without repeating characters within a string I would use a sliding window because by using two pointers we only need to go through the array once thus minimizing the space-time complexity. 

We’ll first create our left and right pointers, adjusting the right pointer while it is less than the length of the array

We’ll increase the left pointer index by 1 if whenever the right pointer points to a value we have seen before

We can check this by adding every value r points to, into a hash map since checking for that maintains a constant space-time complexity O(1)

We’ll also want to declare a variable set to the longest substring which we can update whenever the difference between r and l is greater than our previous largest substring which we can check during the while loop
