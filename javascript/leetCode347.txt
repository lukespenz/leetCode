given array nums and # k return k most frequent elements

first thought is to use a hash map to add each number
in the array to as a key iterating the value with the
number of occurances

then we can use a for loop that checks for the max value
k number of times, deleting the last max value

#BUCKET SORT

We add numbers into their respective 'bucket' based on how
many times it occurs
